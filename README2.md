```
I want to deploy this project as a webapp hosted on an AWS EC2 instance.  See @README.md for any Docker info and create a Dockerfile based on that.  Following best practices from @Guidelines_containerized-application-deployment-AWS.md create setup and deployment scripts.  Also, I've ran into issues with building the container locally, so instead,  modify the deployment script to build the container on the EC2 instance itself to avoid space limitations. As always,  commit changes with detailed message in markdown format, then push to remote repo
